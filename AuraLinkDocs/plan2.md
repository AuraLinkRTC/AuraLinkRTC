# AuraLinkRTC Backend Plan: 5-Phase Journey to Enterprise Production

This document outlines a groundbreaking 5-phase plan for AuraLinkRTC's backend, starting from forking LiveKit to achieving ultra-low latency production. As a backend architecture expert, I've designed an out-of-the-box, innovative system that's never been done before: a geo-distributed, AI-accelerated WebRTC backend with sub-50ms global latency, seamless AI integration, and enterprise-grade reliability. It leverages our 4 microservices, all 7 framework tools, and proprietary optimizations for unmatched performance.

The design prioritizes:
- **Ultra-Low Latency**: <50ms end-to-end for global users via edge AI and real-time caching.
- **AI-First Architecture**: Embedded AI in every layer for intelligent routing and adaptation.
- **Scalability**: Handles 100,000+ concurrent users with auto-scaling.
- **Innovation**: Combines LiveKit fork with novel tech like AI-driven load balancing and quantum-resistant encryption previews.

## Phase 1: Fork LiveKit & Establish Core (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Fork LiveKit as the WebRTC foundation and set up the 4 microservices skeleton.

- **Fork LiveKit**: Clone and fork LiveKit (Go-based) for SFU media routing, SDKs (JS, Swift, Kotlin), and encryption. Customize for AI hooks (e.g., inject AI moderation into streams).
- **Microservices Setup**:
  - **WebRTC Server (Go)**: LiveKit fork with enhanced SFU for 10,000+ users; add real-time AI callbacks.
  - **AI Core (Python)**: FastAPI for AI processing; integrate base LLMs (OpenAI/Anthropic) with BYOK.
  - **Dashboard (Go)**: API gateway for agent creation and shareable links; add RBAC.
  - **Ingress/Egress (Go)**: Handle recordings/streaming with FFmpeg/GStreamer; SIP integration via Twilio.
- **Base Infrastructure**: Deploy on Kubernetes with Supabase (PostgreSQL) and Redis clustering for pub/sub.
- **Latency Innovation**: Add edge nodes (Cloudflare Workers) for initial geo-routing.
- **Milestone**: Basic 1:1 calls work; <100ms latency in single region.

  - **LangGraph (AI Core)**: Stateful AI agents for reasoning (e.g., graph-based moderation).
  - **CrewAI (AI Core)**: Multi-agent teams for collaborative responses in group calls.
  - **Apache Airflow (Ingress/Egress)**: DAGs for post-call analytics (e.g., sentiment analysis).
  - **Prefect (Dashboard/AI Core)**: Dynamic flows for adaptive AI (e.g., switch LLMs based on latency).
  - **AutoGen (AI Core)**: Multi-agent chats for complex Q&A.
  - **Argo Workflows (All Services)**: K8s-native parallel AI jobs for scalability.
- **Memory System Integration**: Embed SuperMemory-inspired system (Connect→Ingest→Embed→Index→Recall→Evolve) via 4 MCPs in AI Core for persistent, graph-based memory; sub-300ms recall for personalized AI. MCPs: Memory MCP (graph-based recall), DeepWiki MCP (real-time docs access), Sequential-Thinking MCP (step-by-step reasoning), Supabase MCP (live DB queries).
- **Microservice Enhancements**:
  - **WebRTC Server**: Add Temporal for call event orchestration; gRPC for low-latency internal comms.
  - **AI Core**: Full AI stack with tools for real-time inference; MCP integrations for memory.
  - **Dashboard**: Orchestration UI for workflows; API versioning.
  - **Ingress/Egress**: Workflow-based media processing; CDN for global distribution.
- **Latency Innovation**: Implement AI-driven load balancing (predict traffic spikes) and real-time caching layers.
- **Milestone**: All tools live; AI features (e.g., translation) work in calls with <80ms latency.

## Phase 3: Optimize for Ultra-Low Latency Architecture (Week 7-10)
**Goal**: Build the "never-been-done" latency architecture: <50ms global, AI-accelerated.

- **AuraLink AIC Protocol Integration**: Implement the groundbreaking AuraLink AIC Protocol (detailed in livekitAIC.md) for AI-driven compression in WebRTC streams. Fork LiveKit, add RTP extensions for AI hints, and achieve 80% BW reduction with <50ms latency. Follow 4-phase plan: Clone/Fork (Week 1), Prepare (Week 2), Integrate (Week 3-4), Test/Deploy (Week 5-6).

- **Microservice Refinements**:
  - **WebRTC Server**: Forked LiveKit with custom SFU for multi-region failover.
  - **AI Core**: Embedded AI for adaptive bitrate/quality based on real-time network analysis.
  - **Dashboard**: Real-time metrics dashboard with AI anomaly detection.
  - **Ingress/Egress**: Edge-based streaming (HLS/WebRTC) for global delivery.
- **Enterprise Security**: mTLS everywhere; audit logs via tools.
- **Latency Innovation**: Achieve <50ms global via AI-driven compression and edge AI.
- **Milestone**: Multi-region calls with <50ms latency in key regions; AI features (e.g., real-time translation) seamless.

- **Premium Monetization**: Offer AuraLink AIC Protocol as an API key option—users/developers enable/disable via Dashboard (+20% cost for BW savings).
