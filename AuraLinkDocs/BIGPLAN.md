# üöÄ AuraLink Development Master Plan

> **AuraLinkRTC Inc.** - Comprehensive 7-Phase Development Roadmap for Intelligent Real-Time Communication Platform

## üìã Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive 7-phase development plan for AuraLinkRTC, a proprietary WebRTC platform with cutting-edge AI integration. The plan focuses on backend development, starting with core infrastructure and progressively building advanced features. Each phase is designed to deliver functional components that build upon previous work, creating a robust, scalable system for intelligent real-time communication.

The development approach follows a microservice architecture with five core services:
1. **WebRTC Server** (media handling)
2. **AI Core** (intelligence)
3. **Dashboard Service** (API/management)
4. **Ingress/Egress** (external media)
5. **Communication Service** (cross-app calling and messaging)

This plan details the systematic development of these services, integration of AI capabilities, and implementation of the innovative AuraLink AIC Protocol for optimized media compression.
