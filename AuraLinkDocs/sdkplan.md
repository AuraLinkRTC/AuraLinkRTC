## Rebranding Process for Each SDK

### Step 1: Repository Forking
```bash
# Example for JavaScript SDK
git clone https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-js.git
cd client-sdk-js
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin https://github.com/DevbyNaveen/auralinkrtc-client-sdk-js.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Code Rebranding
```bash
# Update package names and imports
find . -name "package.json" -exec sed -i 's/"livekit"/"auralinkrtc"/g' {} \;
find . -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.js" | xargs sed -i 's/@livekit/@auralinkrtc/g'
find . -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.js" | xargs sed -i 's/livekit\.cloud/auralinkrtc\.io/g'

# Update documentation
find . -name "*.md" | xargs sed -i 's/LiveKit/AuraLinkRTC/g'
find . -name "*.md" | xargs sed -i 's/livekit/auralinkrtc/g'
```

### Step 3: Backend Server Integration Updates
```javascript
// Change server URLs in SDKs
const SERVER_URL = 'wss://api.auralinkrtc.io'; // Instead of livekit.cloud

// Update API endpoints
const API_BASE = 'https://api.auralinkrtc.io/twirp'; // Instead of livekit api
```

### Step 4: Feature Updates for AuraLinkRTC-Specific Features
Each SDK needs updates to support:
- **AI Integration APIs** (translation, moderation, summarization)
- **Link Sharing features** (custom domains, analytics)
- **Enterprise SSO** (token handling for enterprise auth)
- **Compliance features** (audit logging, data handling)
- **Analytics integration** (usage tracking)

### Step 5: Testing & Validation
- Test against AuraLinkRTC server endpoints
- Validate AI features integration
- Test enterprise authentication flows
- Verify link sharing functionality
- Performance testing with AuraLinkRTC-specific features
