## üé≠ **Usage Scenarios**

### **AuraLinkRTC Managed Services (Non-BYOK)**
- **Voices/TTS**: Pre-selected ElevenLabs voices handled entirely by us.
- **AI Agents**: Our managed LLMs (e.g., GPT models) for talkback.
- **STT**: Our integrated Whisper for transcription.
- **Translation**: Our real-time translation service (10+ languages).
- **Memory**: Our built-in memory service for context storage.

### **BYOK Scenario**
- **Description**: Bring your own keys for customization (ElevenLabs for voices, OpenAI for agents, Whisper for STT).
- **Example**: Enterprise provides ElevenLabs key for custom voices in customer support calls.
- **Benefits**: Full control; integrates with existing tools.

### **Hybrid Scenario**
- **Description**: Mix managed and BYOK features.
- **Example**: Use AuraLink WebRTC but user's Whisper for STT in a tutoring app.
- **Benefits**: Best of both worlds; flexible for complex apps.

### **Shared Memory Scenario**
- **Description**: Connect external memory to AI for central, shareable context.
- **Example**: Link Postgres DB to AI agents for cross-app memory in business automation.
- **Benefits**: Universal memory; enhances AI across platforms.
