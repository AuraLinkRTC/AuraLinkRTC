# AuraLinkRTC Microservice Features

Here are the key features for each microservice in AuraLinkRTC, explained in points. We've focused on the core 2-4 services, drawing from your architecture docs.

## 1. WebRTC Server (Go, Main Media Handler)
- **SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)**: Efficiently routes media streams without transcoding, supporting 10,000+ concurrent users with <100ms latency.
- **Signaling & Peer Connections**: WebSocket-based signaling for ICE, STUN/TURN negotiation, enabling cross-platform calls (web, mobile, embedded).
- **Room & Participant Management**: Creates/joins rooms, tracks participants, handles permissions, and supports group calls up to 1,000+ users.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: DTLS/SRTP for secure communications, compliant with GDPR/HIPAA.
- **Adaptive Bitrate & Quality Monitoring**: Auto-adjusts video quality based on network conditions; provides real-time analytics on call quality (packet loss, jitter, RTT).
- **Screen Sharing & File Exchange**: Backend support for screen capture, file uploads/downloads during calls.
- **TURN/STUN Servers**: NAT traversal for reliable connections in restricted networks.
- **Multi-Region Clustering**: Redis-backed for global scalability, failover, and load balancing.

## 2. AI Core Microservice (Python/FastAPI, AI Processor)
- **AI Agents**: Programmable bots that join calls, respond conversationally, provide summaries, or handle tasks (e.g., tutoring, support); supports BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) for custom LLMs.
- **Memory Service**: Persistent context storage for conversations, preferences, and sessions; integrates with MCP servers for graph-based recall and knowledge enrichment.
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Real-time transcription with noise cancellation; outputs searchable archives and feeds AI processing.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Generates natural speech from text/AI responses; supports custom voices via ElevenLabs or BYOK.
- **Real-Time Translation**: Translates conversations in 10+ languages instantly, preserving context for seamless multi-language calls.
- **AI Moderation**: Detects inappropriate content in real-time across text/audio/video; customizable rules with human oversight.
- **Summarization & Meeting Notes**: Extracts key points, action items, and structured reports; generates follow-ups from call data.
- **MCP Integrations**: Connects to DeepWiki (GitHub docs), Memory (knowledge graphs), Sequential-Thinking (reasoning), and Supabase (live data) for enhanced AI capabilities.

## 3. Dashboard/API Management Service (Go, User Interface Backend)
- **User Dashboard**: Web UI for API key management, analytics, monitoring, and feature toggles (enable/disable AI, memory, etc.).
- **Agent Creation & Management**: Interface to build/customize AI agents, preview voices, and configure MCP integrations.
- **Link Sharing & Access Control**: Generates shareable call links with expiration, analytics on usage, and custom domains.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Real-time metrics on calls, AI usage, quality issues, and compliance logs.
- **Admin Controls**: Role-based access (RBAC), SSO integration, audit trails, and enterprise compliance (GDPR export/deletion).
- **API Gateway**: Centralized routing for SDKs/APIs, rate limiting, and webhook notifications for events (call start/end).
- **Billing & Usage Tracking**: Monitors API calls, AI costs (e.g., TTS characters), and enforces subscription tiers.

## 4. Ingress/Egress Service (Go, Media Processing)
- **Recording & Streaming**: Records calls in MP4/HLS; streams to platforms like YouTube/Twitch for on-demand playback.
- **External Media Ingestion**: Supports RTMP, WHIP, HLS for pulling in external streams (e.g., live events).
- **SIP & Telephony Integration**: Routes AI responses to phone calls via Twilio, enabling voice bots in traditional telephony.
- **Media Processing Queues**: Handles high-volume tasks like video encoding/decoding asynchronously.
- **CDN Integration**: Distributes recorded content globally for low-latency access.
- **Quality Assurance**: Validates media integrity, applies noise cancellation, and ensures compatibility across devices.

These features ensure separation of concerns: WebRTC for media, AI for intelligence, Dashboard for management, and Ingress/Egress for extended media. Total: ~20-25 features across services.
