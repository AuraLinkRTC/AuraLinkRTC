## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Communication Enhancements

To further strengthen inter-service communication and overall system reliability in our **5 microservices** (WebRTC Server, AI Core, Dashboard Service, Ingress/Egress, **Communication Service**), we recommend the following integrations:

### Communication Improvements

- **Adopt a Service Mesh**: Implement Istio or Linkerd for traffic management, including load balancing, circuit breakers, and observability (traces, metrics). This enhances fault tolerance and reduces manual handling.
- **Standardize APIs**: Use gRPC for internal calls where latency is critical, replacing REST for efficient real-time data exchange like media streams.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Expand Redis pub/sub to Kafka for scalable async events (e.g., AI analytics, call events), decoupling services and handling high volumes.
- **Security Hardening**: Enforce mTLS for all inter-service communication to ensure encrypted channels within the cluster.

### Operational Enhancements

- **Monitoring & Logging**: Integrate Prometheus/Grafana for centralized metrics on latency, error rates, and throughput. Add distributed tracing (Jaeger) for debugging bottlenecks.
- **Load Balancing & Scaling**: Deploy Kubernetes ingress controllers or API gateways (e.g., Kong) for external APIs, with horizontal pod autoscaling based on resource usage.
- **Testing**: Implement contract testing (e.g., Pact) for API interactions and chaos engineering (Litmus) to simulate network failures.
