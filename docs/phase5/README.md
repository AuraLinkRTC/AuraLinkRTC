# Phase 5: MCP Integration & AI Agents

## 🎯 Overview

Phase 5 implements advanced AI agent capabilities with Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, multi-agent collaboration frameworks, and dynamic workflow orchestration. This phase transforms AuraLinkRTC from a communication platform into an intelligent, collaborative AI ecosystem.

## 📦 What Was Implemented

### 1. MCP Integration (4 Servers)
- **DeepWiki MCP**: Real-time GitHub repository and documentation access
- **Memory MCP**: Graph-based knowledge management and recall
- **Sequential-Thinking MCP**: Step-by-step reasoning for complex problems
- **Supabase MCP**: Live database queries and operations

### 2. Agent Frameworks (3 Systems)
- **LangGraph**: Stateful multi-step agent workflows with memory
- **CrewAI**: Role-based agent teams for collaborative tasks
- **AutoGen**: Autonomous multi-agent conversations and debates

### 3. Workflow Orchestration
- **Prefect**: Dynamic workflow adaptation based on runtime conditions
- Pre-built workflows: Auto-join, Summarization, Moderation, Q&A

### 4. LLM Selection System
- Support for 20+ models from 4 providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta)
- Intelligent model selection based on cost and performance
- BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) support
- Comprehensive performance tracking and cost optimization

## 🗂️ Files Created

### Database
```
scripts/db/migrations/005_phase5_mcp_agents_schema.sql
- 15 new tables
- 3 materialized views
- Seed data for MCP servers and LLM models
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd auralink-ai-core
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Database Migration

```bash
psql -U postgres -d auralink -f scripts/db/migrations/005_phase5_mcp_agents_schema.sql
```

### 3. Start the Service

```bash
cd auralink-ai-core
python main.py
```

The service will start on port 8001 with all Phase 5 features enabled.
